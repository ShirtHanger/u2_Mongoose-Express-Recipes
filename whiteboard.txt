You will write out the cuisine properties yourself...
Finally:
    when you make ONE json object for each cuisine, and directions for it,
    tell ChatGPT to do the rest for you. You ain't writing allah-dat!

IMPORTANT

Figure out how to get data OTHER THAN USING ID
    *Consider "Get all halal meals (diet_preference)" or "Get all Japanese foods" or "Search by name" or "Search by ingredient" or "Search by serving temp"

Must figure out how to Embed data in a sub document

CONSIDER USING THUNDERCLIENT to populate my data, instead of a seed file. Just seed the Cuisine types? But make schema for everything

ALSO! If you mess up your database, you can always delete it off AtlasDB then reseed!
